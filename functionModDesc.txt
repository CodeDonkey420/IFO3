### general TODO ###
 - refactor error-feedback into popup from stdout txt
 - adjust header definitions of changed funcs

# making new source
main menu / output
-> Button
|-> initSource : new initialized empty source
|-> appendDB : put it into DB
=> enter change mode for new entry

# search DB
in any mode:
search dropdown -> by author / key / ...
enter String into popup
-> searchDB : list of matching indices (int)
filtered output (only indices from list)

# save / load
dropdown in toolbar
-> call backend func
? (maybe implement single export)

# deleteEntry
takes db + entry index -> delete and shuffle all after forwards to close gap

### TODO ###
# show sources
for loop over fields
  if good -> generate label + value
  calculate next output x/y
same for opt fields
// possibly pre-generate grid -> unusedField : visible = false

# change source
like show, but value fields editable
+ save & cancel buttons
(backend: dereference pointer + memcpy into value fields iteratively)
